Step 1: What does this app actually do?
    - Users submit their email and every morning they receive a random bible verse

Step 2: Who or what is involved?
    -The user
    -The flask server
    -The database
    -The email service

Step 3: What are the actions?
    1. User visits the page and submits their email
    2. Flask recieves the email and saves it to the database
    3. Every morning the scheduler wakes up 
    4. Flask grabs all emails from the database
    5. Flask sends each person a verse

Step 4: What pages or routes do I need?
    -'/' serves the homepage with the form
    -'/subscribe' recieves the email and saves it
    -'/send-verse' maybe a manual trigger for testing

Step 5: What files do I need?
    -app.py ---> handles the routes
    -database.py ---> handles the saving and fetching the emails
    -verses.py ---> holds the verses
    -templates/index.html ---> the sign up form
    -.env ---> secret keys

Step 6: What order do I build it in?
    1. Get the homepage showing first
    2. Get the form submitting and printing the email to terminal
    3. Then save it to database
    4. Then get the scheduler sending it to me
    5. Then swap your email out for all emails in the database


## The Full Story
1. User types email and clicks button
2. JS detects the click
3. JS grabs the email from the input box
4. JS sends it to Flask via fetch('/subscribe')
5. Flask receives it and does something with it
6. Flask sends back a response
7. JS receives the response and can show a message to the user




Randome Notes:
request.get_json()  →  opens the envelope, gives you a Python dictionary
jsonify()           →  takes your Python dictionary, puts it in an envelope to send back

Think about everything you built in this project:

HTML form for user input
JavaScript grabbing the value and sending it via POST
Flask receiving and processing the data
SQLite database storing emails
Duplicate email checking
Responses sent back to the user
